Dear readers, 

This file folder contains the following materials in our IWCT 2019 paper <<Using Parameter Mapping to Avoid Forbidden Tuples in a Covering Array>>.
1. the experimental CAs

2. the results of each experiment, including the forbidden tuples and outputs of the three approaches mentioned in our paper.

3. the outputs consist of the following parts.

	- 3.1 original covering array and invalid rows
		The CA and the invalid rows produced by the Identity approach.
		
	- 3.2 pgm covering array and invalid rows
		The CA and the invalid rows produced by the Greedy approach. Note that, to display the CA in a better way, we have adjusted the columns of the CA into a parameter index order from p_1 to p_k.
		
	- 3.3 random covering array and invalid rows
		The CA and the invalid rows produced by the Random approach. Note that due to the implementation limit of our approach, we can only record the output CA of last execution, though actually we have executed the Random approach for 5 times in each experiment. 
		Also, we have adjusted the columns of the CA into a parameter index order.

If you have any questions about the results, please contact with us via e-mail. Thank you!
